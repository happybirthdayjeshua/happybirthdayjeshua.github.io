        Happy birthday loserr<br><br>
        At first, I was considering writing some long sentimental farewell message or something, but to be honest, I don't think it's really necessary.
        AND NO. IT'S NOT AN EXCUSE FOR ME TO BE LAZY. TRUST! It's cuz I'm 100% sure that we'll still stay in contact in the future (as long as you're not the one dubbing first ;( ).
        But for real though, although we probably won't ever be as close as we've been this past year, I think we'll still be besties, yeah?
        Even if we're in college, I've got yo back, so feel free to rant or call me. I might take a while to respond sometimes, but the KEY IS THAT I RESPOND EVENTUALLY!! I always pick up calls tho (even if I'm taking a shit)
        <br><br>
        Good looks for 2020 and 2021.
        <br><br>
        Happy 18th birthday Jeshua :)

        P.S. Your birthday surprise is AN FBI SECRET. FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. Okay?

        HAPPY BIRTHDAY!! Wow you’re finally 18. We should’ve been celebrating at KBBQ today but unfortunately quarantine happened.
        This year has been crazy, from writing college essays to you getting a full ride at NYU now to this lockdown, we still manage to survive. I hope you and your fam are doing well amidst the corona. Anyways this website is sort of me and joseph’s “gift” to you, so I hope you enjoy this. Have a good birthday!!

        P.S. This is your “code” to get free bbtea from me.
